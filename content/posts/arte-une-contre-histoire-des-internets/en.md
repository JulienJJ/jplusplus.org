Journalism++ developed the site of the web documentary "The counter-history of the Internets", co-produced by Arte and Premières Lignes.

The objective of this web documentary: tell and find out why, and how, the internets have changed our lives, identify what we don't have the right to do, what was invented to do it anyway and thus collectively participate in the development of a "counter-history of the Internets", which wants to be free, open and shared.


The site is related to the documentary written by Jean-Marc Manach (@manhack) and Julien Goetz (@juliengoetz),directed by Sylvain Bergère, broadcast on Arte in May 2013.
