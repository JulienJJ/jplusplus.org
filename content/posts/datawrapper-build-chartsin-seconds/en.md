Journalism++ is very proud to take part in [Datawrapper](http://datawrapper.de/). The project was started by Mirko Lorenz and is financed by [ABZV](http://abzv.de/), a German training institute for journalists. The goal is to let any journalist build simple and correct charts in seconds that can then be embedded in articles.

Journalists love the simplicity of the product and the fact that Datawrapper prevents them from publishing wrong charts. The charts design follows the teaching of The Wall Street Journal’s [Dona Wong](http://www.amazon.com/Street-Journal-Guide-Information-Graphics/dp/0393072959). Datawrapper is built in such a way that any media organization can install and customize it quickly.

[@nicolaskb](https://twitter.com/#%21/nicolaskb/) coded the prototype for Datawrapper. Version 1.0 is now developed by [@driven_by_data](https://twitter.com/driven_by_data). Datawrapper is used regularly by [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/), [Ruhr Nachrichten](http://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/) (Dortmund), [L’Avenir](http://www.lavenir.net/) (Belgium) and [RTL.nl](http://www.rtl.nl/experience/rtlnl/) among others.
