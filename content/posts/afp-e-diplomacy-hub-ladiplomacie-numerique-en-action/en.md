Agence France Presse, one of the 3 largest news agencies worldwide, wanted to build a tool to follow diplomatic activity on Twitter. [@Pirhoo](http://twitter.com/pirhoo) took part in writing the specifications of the project and coded the whole app, from getting the data from Twitter to analyzing and visualizing them.

AFP journalists built and maintain a list of over 1000 diplomats and politicians. E-diplomacy then builds indices dynamically, using this list. The data is stored in a [Mongo](http://www.mongodb.org/) database and are served by a lightweight PHP front. Visualizations are done with Javascript libraries such as [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/).

The project was a huge success on launch and allows AFP to be seen as a leading innovator among press agencies.
