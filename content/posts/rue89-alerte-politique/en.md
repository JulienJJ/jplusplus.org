Alerte Politique is a mobile app that provides the user with all election results in the city she is in (works in France only). The user can then configure an alert that will tell her when she enters a city where the party she chose receives a higher proportion of the vote than the preset threshold.

Journalism++ obtained every election result in France since 2002, district by district. They were then cleaned, analyzed and stored in a MySQL DB with over 7 million points. We built an API to serve several apps on iOS and Android.

Alerte Politique was done in partnership with [Rue89](http://www.rue89.com/).
