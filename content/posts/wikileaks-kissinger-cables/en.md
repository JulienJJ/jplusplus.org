Journalism++ worked with Wikileaks to display the information contained in the Kissinger Cables, close to 2 million documents from the State Department's archive. We designed two interfaces together with Wikileaks: One map shows the geographical distribution of the diplomats' interest and a ngram viewer shows the density of key words and phrases over time.

We used the JavaScript library Kartograph.js for the map and D3.js for the Ngram Viewer. One of the trickiest aspect was to render a map of the world in 1975. The borders come from the [CShapes](http://nils.weidmann.ws/projects/cshapes) project files, which we then rearranged. Another challenge was to extract the one billion ngrams in the documents, resulting in a database of over one gigabyte. This was done with the help of Le Zhang's ngram [extraction tools](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/lzhang10/ngram.html).
