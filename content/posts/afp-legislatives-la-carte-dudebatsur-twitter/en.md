A few weeks before local elections in France in May 2012, Agence France Presse and Slate.fr launched [a series of hashtags](http://www.afp.com/fr/legislatives-hashtags-circonscriptions) on Twitter, one for each voting district. Thousands of journalists and Twitter users started using these, so that AFP needed to visualize the conversation district by district.

Journalism++ came up with a solution in a matter of days. We built an automated tweet extractor through the Twitter API and visualized the data using [Kartograph.js](https://github.com/kartograph/).

The app was put together in a few days by [@nicolaskb](https://twitter.com/#%21/nicolaskb/). It was largely seen as a point of reference by other media outlets, showing that AFP was the leader when it came to monitoring social networks.
