Feowl tracks power cuts in Douala, the busiest city in Cameroon. Journalism++ received funding from the [International Press Institute ](http://www.ipinewscontest.org/)to build this data collection and visualization service, alongside with [Tesobe](http://www.tesobe.com/), [Internet Sans Frontières ](http://www.internetsansfrontieres.com/)and [Wasamundi](http://www.wasamundi.com/).

Feowl acts as a polling platform. Users register and are then asked how many power cuts they suffered from on any given day. Polling occurs via email or SMS. Collected data is then cleaned and analysed to provide sound statistics about the problem to local stakeholders.

The project is largely followed by local and international journalists. As it’s open source, others can deploy their own version of Feowl anywhere to monitor any long-term issue, like water cuts or inflation. [See the code on GitHub](https://github.com/feowl/).
