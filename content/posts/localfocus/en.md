LocalFocus is a data-driven news service especially designed for local and regional journalists. We collect data from numerous sources either by hand or automated through one of our scrapers. Datasets are easily searchable by region or subject so local journalists know instantly whatâ€™s of interest to them and build stories around the data. Clean and customized graphs and maps can be generated through our platform to present the stories in a more visual way.
