Journalism++ is a network of companies and individuals who share a common brand and stand for common values. This manifesto lays out the 10 points that make us who we are.



	
  1. We are news nerds. We are journalists, developers, designers or project managers who share a common passion for news and technology.

  2. We believe that the presentation of journalism can be vastly improved, that journalists have not been able to think outside of the old boxes that we used to call print, radio and television.

  3. We believe that data is increasingly important for anyone who wants to understand modern society, including journalists. We are indebted to Adrian Holovaty and his milestone article, [A Fundamental Way Newspapers Sites Must Change](http://www.holovaty.com/writing/fundamental-change/).

  4. We believe in journalism. We do not think that automation can replace journalists. We believe that humans can be the best of storytellers. But their work can be transformed for the better thanks to modern technology.

  5. We define journalism as making interesting what is important and we will refrain from making important what is interesting.

  6. We believe that journalism escaped newsrooms. That’s why we believe that we can produce good journalism when we work with institutions, corporations and other non-media organizations.

  7. We believe that open beats closed. Open source is our default behavior. Our code lives at [github.com/jplusplus](https://github.com/jplusplus). Only when we cannot do otherwise will we not publish our code.

  8. We believe in the community. We are what we are thanks to the countless persons who helped us along the way. We will give back as much as we can to the community.

  9. We’re not in (only) for the money. We work to improve storytelling and journalism for all those that have a story to tell. We will not help in spreading lies or in spinning information. We will not work with companies that specialize in manufacturing weapons intended mainly to kill humans or in dependence-inducing drugs such as alcoholic products and cigarettes.

  10. We speak English. Because English is the most widely shared language on the internet, we write our comments, the names of our functions and variables and our external communication in American English.
