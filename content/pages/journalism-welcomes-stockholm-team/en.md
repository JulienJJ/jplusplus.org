Two of the finest datajournalists in Sweden, Jens Finnäs and Peter Grensund, are launching the Stockholm chapter of Journalism++. After Paris and Berlin, Stockholm is the third city where datajournalists and developers operating under the Journalism++ flag become active.





Journalism++ is a network of companies and individuals exploring new ways of doing and presenting journalism in our rapidly evolving media landscape. Emerging trends in journalism, such as datajournalism, are only starting to find their ways into newsrooms. Nate Silver, for instance, turned political journalism on its head with his millimeter precise forecasts of the American presidential elections. Journalistic output does no longer have to be 700 words and a picture, as[ realizations from the New-York Times or the Guardian](http://marijerooze.nl/thesis/) show.



In guiding standards of Journalism++ are summerized in the Journalim++ Manifesto, which is also presented today.

Journalism++ Stockholm will be the first agency dedicated to datajournalism in Sweden. “The interest in datajournalism is growing rapidly in Scandinavia, but there is still a gap of knowledge and experience in the newsrooms. This is where we hope to come in”, says Jens Finnäs, known under the blogger pseudonyme[ Dataist](http://dataist.wordpress.com/). Thanks to his Finnish background, he is also confident that he will expand the network in Finland.

“Structured research and analysis not only provides a great starting point for further news coverage and investigation, it's pushing journalists and developers together, creating immensely cool stuff. It's good fun!” said Peter Grensund, who won the[ Swedish Grand Journalism Prize 2012](http://www.storajournalistpriset.se/category/pristyp/arets-fornyare/) for his contribution to the crowdsourcing project Räntekartan.

The Stockholm chapter of Journalism++ is an independent entity. It shares the Journalism++ brand under a joint agreement with the French company Journalism++ SAS, which continues to operate the Paris and Berlin chapters of the network.
“The whole agreement was completed in a matter of days”, says CEO of the Paris chapter Nicolas Kayser-Bril. “We are expecting to welcome other teams in the network in the coming months.”

“Our goal is to become a global network of like-minded people and be able to leverage this talent to carry out large-scale, ground-breaking projects” says Pierre Romera, also known as Pirhoo, CTO of the Paris chapter of Journalism++. “This cooperation is truly unique, we’re excited to work on a European scale”, he added.

Journalism++ contributes to developing open source projects such as[ Feowl](http://feowl.com), a platform to monitor power cuts in Douala, Cameroon, or[ Datawrapper](http://datawrapper.de), a data visualization project. It also develops custom projects for media clients such as Agence France-Presse and Arte. Jens and Peter have previously worked with media such as Svenska Dagbladet and Sveriges Radio in Sweden and Helsingin Sanomat and Yle in Finland.
